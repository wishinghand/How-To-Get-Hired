## A Job is Just a Job
You are trading time and labor for capital.

Don't fall in love with a position.

It will never love you back.

# So you need a job
## 5 tips to get you hired

---
# 1. Don't Panic
## Keep living life

- Eat Right
- Get Sleep
- See your friends/family

---
## 2. What Do You Want?
- Front/back end or full stack? Mobile? DevOps?
- Startup, enterprise, contract, non-profit?
- SaaS, B2B, B2C, E-commerce?
- Find what satisfies you

---
## Are You Experienced?
- Every job description is a wish list
- Unless it's wildly out of your skill set, you can probably get it
- If you don't know something on the list, Youtube, Udemy, Egghead

---
## Look online
Check out Indeed/Monster/etc

<p class="fragment">But don't use them to apply!</p>

---
## 3. Find out who's in charge

---
## The "No" Person

1. It's their job to say "no" to that stack of resumes from Indeed

2. It's your job to get them to say yes


---
## Target Acquisition
- Look at the company's staff page, find the senior developers (never the CTO unless it's a startup)
- Check if they have in-house recruiters
- Contact someone in HR as a last resort


---
## 4. Don't You Forget About Me
- Don't let more than 4 days go by without a message contact
- Don't harass, just ask if they've had a look at your resume
- Only give up after 14+ days of no response

---
## Go Pro
- Get a LinkedIn Pro account
- Free for the first 30 days
- Send a direct message & connection request to your targets ⬆️

---
## First Contact Message
#### Why does a Company Hire?
1. To save time
2. To save money
3. To do something they don't know how (which is really a combo of 1 & 2)
4. Your message needs to convey 1, 2, or 3

---
## Be Accessible
- Setup a site w/screenshots/gifs of your app(s)
- No one has time to install the source so make a portfolio page
- Host it on Now.sh
- Get a great README on your repos: http://bit.ly/nice-readme
- Host an HTML resume on your site w/PDF download

## Look The part
- Business casual attire is fine, no tie needed
- Men: Get leather shoes, all black sneakers won't cut it
- Women: slacks & blouse are fine, no heels needed
- If they say don't wear a suit...

# Don't wear a suit

# 5. Seal the Deal

---
## Walk the Walk
- Arrive 10 minutes early
- Accept a water if they ask you if you want something
- Go over your interview questions
- DO NOT TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE

<p class="fragment">You know what? Just leave it at home</p>

---
- Bring a leather portfolio with:
    - 10+ copies of your resume
    - A pen
    - A blank pad of paper
    - A sheet of questions to ask them

---
## Talk the talk
<p>Interviews are a two way street</p>

- Questions from the updated Joel Test
- How long have the senior devs been at this company?
- Is there a mentor system in place?
- What would your ideal candidate look like 6 months from now?
- YOU MUST ASK THEM QUESTIONS

---
## Seal the Deal
- Speak as if you're a strong candidate
- Ask what the next steps are
- Thank them: <a>thankyouletter.ws</a>
- Remember the 4 day rule

---
## Secret Step 6:
## Connections are Everything
- I've found 4 jobs through meetups
- Go to one at least once a week
- Vary them, don't always go to the same ones
- Make sure you talk to at least 4-5 people
